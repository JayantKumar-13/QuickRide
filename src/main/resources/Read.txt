1). We can Implement The cancelRide , endRide and all the methods which are same to both driver and user by creating a base User class
but that will not be a good practise as it will require a lot of if else blocks.

2). Backend Testing , Timer Integrate from start to end Ride , Add logout API in auth controller

3). \d tablename in postgres

4). JWT is stateless , why ?
